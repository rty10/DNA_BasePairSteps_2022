# Project: Updating Elastic Energy Potential of DNA at the Base-pair Step Levelt

This repository is designed to shared raw, culled, and filtered data collected from the Protein DataBank (www.rcsb.org) in 2022 and summarily processed to developed an updated set of dimer and tetramer elastic potentials for use with the emDNA optimization software package.

This data was initially published in 2022 in the journal Life under the title "Revisiting DNA Sequence-Dependent Deformability in High-Resolution Structures: Effects of Flanking Base Pairs on Dinucleotide Morphology and Global Chain Configuration" [doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/life12050759].
This repository contains the directory "Biophysical_Journal_2024" meant to store working notebooks and figures generated for a review article in collaboration with Dr. Wilma K. Olson.
