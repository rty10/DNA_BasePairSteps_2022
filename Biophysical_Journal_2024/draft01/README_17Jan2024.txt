Figure 2: slide v. twist scatter with 1-sigma, 2-sigma, 3-sigma contours of 512 random tetrameric points of (a) internal CA and (b) internal AC
- make sure the contour lines are for the full tetrameric dataset

Figure 3: slide v. Twist and Roll scatters + 3-sigma contours in 4-by-4 grid for all (a) internal CA and (b) internal AC tetramers
- already made in the past
    - crispen the edges, improve clarity and coloring for figures
- side figure: compare GCAT and TACG side-by-side
